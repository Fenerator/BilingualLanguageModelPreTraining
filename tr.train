cynthesizer is a high-level synthesis tool . " high level " in this context means designers can describe the functionality of a complex electronic system as a pure algorithm in systemc . the designer can then direct cynthesizer to produce a unique hardware architecture that implements the system in a specific number of clock cycles . this replaces the traditional method of using a hardware description language like verilog or vhdl , where the designer must manually write out the usage of hardware components in a fixed schedule of clock cycles . if designers want hardware with different performance , they can redirect cynthesizer to produce a new architecture that is faster or smaller , whereas with the traditional method a completely new design must be written . the output of cynthesizer is verilog , which is then run automatically through a logic synthesis tool .

" in the 2000s , it was sofia karlsson . " " expressen " gave it 3 / 5 . the reviewer anders dahlbom " after the unexpected huge success of the 2005 " svarta ballader , " this album feels like a logical sequel . karlsson puts new life into material from dan andersson , wiehe , peps and taube among others . and although some track selections feels rather predictable karlsson 's detailed traditional folk sounds strangely timeless . its success is likely to continue , both on the sales lists and tours . " " norran " gave the disc 4 / 5 . the reviewer olle lundqvist wrote : " she is one of the new milliennium 's musical exclamation marks , and excitement about sofia karlsson is not likely to die down with this album . " a little later in the review , he continued : " the interpretations are straight , yet personal . the voice also . there is nothing ingratiating , but plenty of individuality and integrity . this is song with style and soul . " " sundsvalls tidning " awarded 4 / 5 . the reviewer per-roger carlsson wrote : " now she offers more variation , but sofia lives on her expression and is firmly rooted in song . no experiment and improvisation , but with song tradition as her fixed point . " the review ended with " fine vocal art from a great vocal artist . " " svenska dagbladet " s review gave the disc 4 / 6 . the reviewer ingrid stromdahl wrote : " two poems by baudelaire in dan andersson 's interpretation and sofie livebrant 's musical setting . taube 's heart-stopping ballad about the brig " bluebird " and bellman 's " mark how our shadow , " earlier recorded by joakim thastrom . wiehe 's " the girl and the crow , " alf hambe , peps , and more ... a diverse collection of songs that sofia karlsson sings sensitively and with lovely ornamentation to the varied orchestration . " " ostgota correspondenten " rated it 4 / 5 and wrote " of course , the music is absolutely perfect , but the piano and the wind instruments are unbalanced so that it is not only beautiful , but a little bit bitter , too .

in alevi thought there are three creative principles : the latent breath called haqq or " allah " ; the prototypal human which is made up of active and passive principles called yol , sunnah or " muhammad " ( the jem ) ; and the divine light called nur expressed as " ali . " comparisons between communion ( ittihad ) in alevism and the christian trinity , whose three principles are called the father , the son and the holy spirit , notwithstanding , it is not comparable with the tritheistic conceptions of hinduism , with brahma , shiva and vishnu , and certainly not with polytheistic ancient egypt in osiris , isis and horus , one cannot accurately depict such examples as being representative of the haqq-muhammad-ali communion ( ittihad ) , since according to alevi or bektashi beliefs ( wahdat al-mawjud ) , only allah is a real entity , muhammad and ali being simple manifestations of the way ( yol ) and the light ( noor ) of allah ( haqq ) and not of allah himself , hence they are neither equal to it nor separate independent entities . this doctrine does , however , bear similarities to the " smarta " hindu view of " brahman . " in alevism , muhammad is the means by which the nasut ( human nature ) of the avlioh ( saints ) achieve ittihad ( communion ) with haqq being the lahut ( divine nature ) of allah . it has more in common with theosis and the distinction and unity of the divine and human physes in orthodox christology than it does with any kind of tritheism .
a group can be considered " alive , " " dead , " or " unsettled " based on whether two eyes can be made regardless of how the opponent plays . naturally , one space is insufficient . two adjacent spaces are insufficient to make two eyes as well , since putting a stone in will create one eye only . the opponent can simply fill in one of the two spots , threatening to fill in the other , forcing the player to capture that one by playing in the second one . then , the opponent simply plays there again , killing the group . usually this will not be done during the game , but at the end , during calculation , the group will be labeled " dead " and removed as prisoners . the only way to actually remove a group from the board is to fill its " eye space " with all but one , forcing it to capture the filling-in group by putting a stone in the last space . if the created group is not alive , then continuing this process will eventually kill the entire group .
