cynthesizer is a high-level synthesis tool . " high level " in this context means designers can describe the functionality of a complex electronic system as a pure algorithm in systemc . the designer can then direct cynthesizer to produce a unique hardware architecture that implements the system in a specific number of clock cycles . this replaces the traditional method of using a hardware description language like verilog or vhdl , where the designer must manually write out the usage of hardware components in a fixed schedule of clock cycles . if designers want hardware with different performance , they can redirect cynthesizer to produce a new architecture that is faster or smaller , whereas with the traditional method a completely new design must be written . the output of cynthesizer is verilog , which is then run automatically through a logic synthesis tool .

" " expressen " gave it 3 / 5 . the reviewer anders dahlbom " after the unexpected huge success of the 2005 " svarta ballader , " this album feels like a logical sequel . karlsson puts new life into material from dan andersson , wiehe , peps and taube among others . and although some track selections feels rather predictable karlsson 's detailed traditional folk sounds strangely timeless . its success is likely to continue , both on the sales lists and tours . " " norran " gave the disc 4 / 5 . the reviewer olle lundqvist wrote : " she is one of the new milliennium 's musical exclamation marks , and excitement about sofia karlsson is not likely to die down with this album . " a little later in the review , he continued : " the interpretations are straight , yet personal . the voice also . there is nothing ingratiating , but plenty of individuality and integrity . this is song with style and soul . " " sundsvalls tidning " awarded 4 / 5 . the reviewer per-roger carlsson wrote : " now she offers more variation , but sofia lives on her expression and is firmly rooted in song . no experiment and improvisation , but with song tradition as her fixed point . " the review ended with " fine vocal art from a great vocal artist . " " svenska dagbladet " s review gave the disc 4 / 6 . the reviewer ingrid stromdahl wrote : " two poems by baudelaire in dan andersson 's interpretation and sofie livebrant 's musical setting . taube 's heart-stopping ballad about the brig " bluebird " and bellman 's " mark how our shadow , " earlier recorded by joakim thastrom . wiehe 's " the girl and the crow , " alf hambe , peps , and more ... a diverse collection of songs that sofia karlsson sings sensitively and with lovely ornamentation to the varied orchestration . " " ostgota correspondenten " rated it 4 / 5 and wrote " of course , the music is absolutely perfect , but the piano and the wind instruments are unbalanced so that it is not only beautiful , but a little bit bitter , too .

in alevi thought there are three creative principles : the latent breath called haqq or " allah " ; the prototypal human which is made up of active and passive principles called yol , sunnah or " muhammad " ( the jem ) ; and the divine light called nur expressed as " ali . " comparisons between communion ( ittihad ) in alevism and the christian trinity , whose three principles are called the father , the son and the holy spirit , notwithstanding , it is not comparable with the tritheistic conceptions of hinduism , with brahma , shiva and vishnu , and certainly not with polytheistic ancient egypt in osiris , isis and horus , one cannot accurately depict such examples as being representative of the haqq-muhammad-ali communion ( ittihad ) , since according to alevi or bektashi beliefs ( wahdat al-mawjud ) , only allah is a real entity , muhammad and ali being simple manifestations of the way ( yol ) and the light ( noor ) of allah ( haqq ) and not of allah himself , hence they are neither equal to it nor separate independent entities . this doctrine does , however , bear similarities to the " smarta " hindu view of " brahman . " in alevism , muhammad is the means by which the nasut ( human nature ) of the avlioh ( saints ) achieve ittihad ( communion ) with haqq being the lahut ( divine nature ) of allah . it has more in common with theosis and the distinction and unity of the divine and human physes in orthodox christology than it does with any kind of tritheism .
a group can be considered " alive , " " dead , " or " unsettled " based on whether two eyes can be made regardless of how the opponent plays . naturally , one space is insufficient . two adjacent spaces are insufficient to make two eyes as well , since putting a stone in will create one eye only . the opponent can simply fill in one of the two spots , threatening to fill in the other , forcing the player to capture that one by playing in the second one . then , the opponent simply plays there again , killing the group . usually this will not be done during the game , but at the end , during calculation , the group will be labeled " dead " and removed as prisoners . the only way to actually remove a group from the board is to fill its " eye space " with all but one , forcing it to capture the filling-in group by putting a stone in the last space . if the created group is not alive , then continuing this process will eventually kill the entire group .

the michelson-morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the " aether wind " - the motion of the aether relative to the earth . michelson designed an instrument called the michelson interferometer to accomplish this . the apparatus was sufficiently accurate to detect the expected effects , but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881 , and again in 1887 . although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment , the results were accepted by the scientific community . in an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm , fitzgerald and lorentz independently created an " ad hoc " hypothesis in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether . this was the origin of fitzgerald-lorentz contraction , and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis . the interpretation of the null result of the michelson-morley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is isotropic ( independent of direction ) , but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity .

for the majority of christian denominations , the holy spirit , or holy ghost , is believed to be the third person of the trinity , a triune god manifested as god the father , god the son , and god the holy spirit , each entity itself being god . nontrinitarian christians , who reject the doctrine of the trinity , differ significantly from mainstream christianity in their beliefs about the holy spirit . in christian theology , pneumatology is the study of the holy spirit . due to christianity 's historical relationship with judaism , theologians often identify the holy spirit with the concept of the " ruach hakodesh " in jewish scripture , on the theory that jesus ( who was jewish ) was expanding upon these jewish concepts . similar names , and ideas , include the " ruach elohim " ( spirit of god ) , " ruach yhwh " ( spirit of yahweh ) , and the " ruach hakodesh " ( holy spirit ) . in the new testament it is identified with the spirit of christ , the spirit of truth , the paraclete and the holy spirit .

qnx interprocess communication consists of sending a message from one process to another and waiting for a reply . this is a single operation , called codice _ 3 . the message is copied , by the kernel , from the address space of the sending process to that of the receiving process . if the receiving process is waiting for the message , control of the cpu is transferred at the same time , without a pass through the cpu scheduler . thus , sending a message to another process and waiting for a reply does not result in " losing one 's turn " for the cpu . this tight integration between message passing and cpu scheduling is one of the key mechanisms that makes qnx message passing broadly usable . most unix and linux interprocess communication mechanisms lack this tight integration , although a user space implementation of qnx-type messaging for linux does exist . mishandling of this subtle issue is a primary reason for the disappointing performance of some other microkernel systems such as early versions of mach . the recipient process need not be on the same physical machine .

very rapid growth takes place during the growth phase of the production cycle . for about 10-11 weeks , it is critical that the juvenile kits have access to adequate amounts of feed that is formulated to meet their nutritional needs . maintaining a feeding routine that allows for multiple distributions of feed a day will help keep feed fresh and encourage appetite . in july , all mink ( including kits and adult breeders ) are vaccinated to prevent diseases and promote health and welfare of the herd . once august arrives , the skeletal growth of kits is complete and the subsequent growth of primarily fat begins . the growth of fur predominantly takes place during the fall where it begins at the tail and continues up the back and to the head . ranchers maintain a clean , healthy environment during this time by performing daily husbandry practices , this includes ; cleaning nest boxes , removal of surrounding debris and manure from the barn , bedding the cages , and up-keeping the cleanliness of the facility and farming equipment . ranchers are diligent toward creating an environment that prioritizes the welfare of each animal and allows them to live and function comfortably within their environment .
dccs are similar to analog compact cassettes , except that there are no " bulges " where the tape-access holes are located . dcc cassettes are flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on the top side ( they are not required because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all dcc decks ) , so this side can be used for a larger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette . a spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and minidiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use . cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that dcc recorders can tell a dcc apart from an analog compact cassette , and so they can tell what the length of a dcc tape is . also , there is a sliding write-protect tab on the dcc to enable and disable recording . unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and vhs tapes , this tab makes it easier to make a tape recordable again , and unlike on analog compact cassettes , the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side .

" he circumcised his sons and himself and declared that his community was jewish . according to henry lubega , " he fled to the foot of mt . elgon and settled in a place called gangama where he started a separatist sect known as kibina kya bayudaya abesiga katonda ( the community of jews who trust in the lord ) .

root parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination . for germination to occur , seeds need to be quite close to the host plant . for example , the seeds of witchweed ( " striga asiatica " ) need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters ( mm ) of its host to receive chemical signals in the soil to trigger germination . this range is important because " striga asiatica " will only grow about 4 mm after germination . chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host 's root system into the surrounding soil . these chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them . parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough . these compounds are called strigolactones . strigolactone stimulates ethylene biosynthesis in seeds causing them to germinate .

unbeknownst to domhnall , he was actually describing the first use of poison gas by the " british " army on the western front , which resulted in one of the most disastrous friendly fire incidents of the first world war . on the first day of the battle of loos , chlorine gas , codenamed " red star , " was deployed ( 140 tons arrayed in 5,100 gas cylinders ) and aimed at the german sixth army 's positions on the hohenzollern redoubt . the wind , however , proved fickle and the gas either lingered in no man 's land or blew right back into british trenches . escalating the situation , an extremely well-aimed and retaliatory artillery barrage resulted in german shells exploding upon the unused gas cylinders and releasing even " more " poison gas throughout british lines . what is worse , the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to british tommies before the gas was deployed quickly grew hot , and the small eye-pieces misted over and severely reduced visibility . some tommies lifted the masks to see better or to get fresh air and were gassed as well . the use of poison gas during the battle of loos caused 10 deaths and at least 2,000 cases of serious injury to british soldiers . furthermore , the use of poison gas on the first day of the battle of loos constituted a british war crime , as its use violated the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the 1907 hague convention on land warfare , which prohibited the use of " poison or poisoned weapons " during warfare .

sethi 's musical work often explores the myriad intersections of art , philosophy , scripture , and music . sethi is a vocal advocate for pluralism and tolerance and is known for his experimental approach to music . his music is known to touch upon themes that challenge prevailing views on gender identity and sexuality . this stems from his own experiences as a queer artist . sethi often uses or references sufi poetry in his music which adopts an " inclusive " and liberal view on such issues . he has stated that " sufi poems and metaphors revel in ambiguity , undoing such binaries as sacred and secular , male and female , spiritual and material . in that sense i think they are like this incredible technology of the heart - one that can help us do dialogue across difference in this highly polarized time . " sethi also acknowledges that " the appetite for sufi music in pakistan allows people like me to get away with a lot of potentially subversive stuff through the metaphors of sufi poetry - these beautiful , deliberate ambiguities .

in the netherlands , the mutiny and its bloody conclusion had a deep impact , a blot on the record of defence minister deckers and prime minister ruijs de beerenbrouck . historian louis de jong accounts it as one of the most significant dutch events in the 1930s . as j. c. h. blom notes , the main effect of the spectacular incident - at least in the short term - was to cause a shift to the right , clearly manifest in the general elections two months later , in april 1933 . the government proceeded to root out social-democratic influences among naval unions and civil servants , since " such ' unreliable elements ' threatened the loyalty of the armed forces and with it the nation 's hold on its seemingly indispensable overseas possessions . " in this it was supported , as blom notes , by the officer corps as well as by the predominantly sociopolitical groups in the country ( calvinist , catholic , and liberal ) . apprehensive of appearing " unpatriotic , " the social democratic workers ' party was unable to offer an effective defence , and in the april elections lost two seats , setting back - as it turned out only temporarily - their march towards strength and respectability in the political mainstream .

traditionally , the basic level of annotation is using blast for finding similarities , and then annotating genomes based on homologues . more recently , additional information is added to the annotation platform . the additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation . some databases use genome context information , similarity scores , experimental data , and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their subsystems approach . other databases ( e.g. ensembl ) rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline . " structural annotation " consists of the identification of genomic elements , primarily orfs and their localisation , or gene structure . " functional annotation " consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements .

the structure of sonnet 32 can be interpreted in light of its relationship to time . " the exact match created between events as foreseen by the poet ( his death , the increasing poetic sophistication of the age and consequently of the beloved 's taste ) and the beloved 's conjectured thought as he rereads the poet 's verse makes intelligible shakespeare 's choice of a structure of superposition ( in which lines 9-14 [ beloved 's thought ] repeat lines 3-8 [ speaker 's wish ] ) .

on some occasions , members of the " volkssturm " showed tremendous courage and a determined will to resist , more so even than soldiers in the " wehrmacht . " the " volkssturm " battalion 25 / 235 for instance , started out with 400 men but fought on until there were only 10 men remaining . fighting at kustrin between 30 january to 29 march 1945 , militia units made up mostly of the " volkssturm " resisted for nearly two months . losses were upwards of 60 percent for the " volkssturm " at kolberg , roughly 1900 of them died at breslau , and during the battle of konigsberg ( kaliningrad ) , another 2400 members of the " volkssturm " were killed . at other times along the western front particularly , " volkssturm " troops would cast their arms aside and disappear into the chaos . youthful ardor and fanaticism among hitler youth members fighting with the " volkssturm " or an insatiable sense of duty from old men proved tragic sometimes . an example shared by historian stephen fritz is instructive in this case :

the main idea of multigrid is to accelerate the convergence of a basic iterative method ( known as relaxation , which generally reduces short-wavelength error ) by a " global " correction of the fine grid solution approximation from time to time , accomplished by solving a coarse problem . the coarse problem , while cheaper to solve , is similar to the fine grid problem in that it also has short- and long-wavelength errors . it can also be solved by a combination of relaxation and appeal to still coarser grids . this recursive process is repeated until a grid is reached where the cost of direct solution there is negligible compared to the cost of one relaxation sweep on the fine grid . this multigrid cycle typically reduces all error components by a fixed amount bounded well below one , independent of the fine grid mesh size . the typical application for multigrid is in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations in two or more dimensions .

the immobilization by interpenetration of actin filaments results from two distinct abp families . the gelsolin protein family is believed to be the most efficient in the disruption of actin filaments and is considered a " strong severing protein . " these proteins respond to an increase in ca2 + and cap the " barbed end " of the recently severed f-actin . the increased level of ca2 + may also destabilize the actin-filament network by interfering with the binding of crosslinking proteins . the adf / cofilin protein family also serves to severe actin-filament networks through the weak severing of actin networks . this form of weak severing does not tightly cap the " barbed ends " but does allow for the disassociation of actin monomers and thus the disassembly of f-actin .

the construction of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect a lack of means for the force that uses them . this is especially true in developing countries , where various armies and guerrilla forces have used them ( e.g. during the toyota war ) , as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles .
jackson 's name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties . " the age of jackson " shaped the national agenda and american politics . jackson 's philosophy as president was similar to that of jefferson , advocating republican values held by the revolutionary generation . jackson took a moral tone , with the belief that agrarian sympathies , and strong states rights with a limited federal government , would produce less corruption . he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values . when south carolina opposed the tariff law , he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession .
the pennsylvania academic standards require students to learn about darwin 's theory of evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part . because darwin 's theory is a theory , it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered . the theory is not a fact . gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence . a theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations . intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from darwin 's view . the reference book , " of pandas and people , " is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves . with respect to any theory , students are encouraged to keep an open mind . the school leaves the discussion of the origins of life to individual students and their families . as a standards-driven district , class instruction focuses upon preparing students to achieve proficiency on standards-based assessments .

with livestreaming becoming a financially viable market , particularly for esports , streamers and organizations representing them have looked for metrics to quantify the viewership of streams as to be able to determine pricing for advertisers . metrics like maximum number of concurrent viewers , or number of subscribers do not readily account for how long a viewer may stay to watch a stream . the most common metric is the " average minute audience " ( ama ) , which is obtained by taking the total minutes watched by all viewers on the stream during the streamed event and for 24 hours afterwards , divided by the number of minutes that were broadcast . the ama is comparable to the same metric that the nielsen ratings for tracking viewership . this also makes it possible to combine standard broadcast and streaming routes for events that are simulcasted on both forms of delivery to estimate total audience size major events with reported ama include streamed national football league games ; for example , the average ama for nfl games in 2018 ranged from 240,000 to 500,000 across streaming services , with the following super bowl liv having an ama of 2.6 million . in comparison , the esports overwatch league had an average of 313,000 average minute audience during regular season games in its 2019 season .

one of the most fundamental concepts to understanding nanocircuits is the formulation of moore 's law . this concept arose when intel co-founder gordon moore became interested in the cost of transistors and trying to fit more onto one chip . it relates that the number of transistors that can be fabricated on a silicon integrated circuit - and therefore the computing abilities of such a circuit - is doubling every 18 to 24 months . the more transistors one can fit on a circuit , the more computational abilities the computer will have . this is why scientists and engineers are working together to produce these nanocircuits so increasingly more and more transistors will be able to fit onto a chip . despite how good this may sound , there are many problems that arise when so many transistors are packed together . with circuits being so tiny , they tend to have more problems than larger circuits , more particularly heat - the amount of power applied over a smaller surface area makes heat dissipation difficult , this excess heat will cause errors and can destroy the chip . nanoscale circuits are more sensitive to temperature changes , cosmic rays and electromagnetic interference than today 's circuits . as more transistors are packed onto a chip , phenomena such as stray signals on the chip , the need to dissipate the heat from so many closely packed devices , tunneling across insulation barriers due to the small scale , and fabrication difficulties will halt or severely slow progress . there will be a time when the cost of making circuits even smaller will be too much , and the speed of computers will reach a maximum . for this reason , many scientists believe that moore 's law will not hold forever and will soon reach a peak , since moore 's law is largely predicated on computational gains caused by improvements in micro-lithographic etching technologies .

in the mid-1990s , observations of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate that they were about 15 billion years old , which conflicted with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe ( and indeed with the age measured today ) . this issue was later resolved when new computer simulations , which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds , indicated a much younger age for globular clusters . while there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured , globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe .

aside from vocalization , females in this genus may choose males based on nest or territory quality . for example , in boreal owls , the number and quality of nest holes or boxes defended by males is a factor in female reproductive effort . the number and quality of nests appear to serve a direct benefit to females ( direct benefit hypothesis ) , as it provides protection from predation , as well as access to food resources , as good nest quality can be indicated by access to prey ( i.e. small mammals ) . female boreal owls ' reproductive success can decline in polyterritorial polygamous situations , as females are unable to discriminate previously paired and unpaired males ( also known as the deception hypothesis ) . it is also important to note that increasing polygamy levels leads to decreased reproductive success in secondary females . limited research has been conducted into mate choice of the northern saw-whet owl in relation to territory quality . some researchers suggest they follow a similar trend to boreal owls , where the quality of nests is a direct benefit to the female and therefore a determining factor . northern saw-whet owls ' nest locations appear less linked to the availability of small mammals , as they have a greater variety of prey options and tend to be more nomadic after each breeding season .

this method attempts to correct the bias again , but through very different means . rather than trying to fix the absolute magnitudes , this method takes the distances to the objects as being the random variables and attempts to rescale those . in effect , rather than giving the stars in the sample the correct distribution of absolute magnitudes ( and average absolute magnitude ) , it attempts to ' move ' the stars such that they would have a correct distribution of distances . ideally , this should have the same end result as the magnitude correction methods and should result in a correctly represented sample . in either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous case , the bias is defined in terms of a prior distribution of distances , the distance estimator , and the likelihood function of these two being the same distribution . the homogeneous case is much simpler and rescales the raw distance estimates by a constant factor . unfortunately , this will be very insensitive to large scale structures such as clustering as well as observational selection effects , and will not give a very accurate result . the inhomogeneous case attempts to correct this by creating a more complicated prior distribution of objects by taking into account structures seen in the observed distribution . in both cases though , it is assumed that the probability density function is gaussian with constant variance and a mean of the true average log distance , which is far from accurate . however , this method is debated and may not be accurate in any implementation due to uncertainties in calculating the raw , observed distance estimates causing the assumptions to use this method to be invalid .
pre-islamic arabs were worshippers of other gods . the kaaba was still the center of their worship , and was filled with idols and images of angels . during the annual pilgrimage season , people from home and abroad would visit the kaaba . the quraysh tribe was in charge of entertaining and serving the pilgrims . shibli nomani mentions that the pagan arabs introduced some unholy rites during their pilgrimage . unlike today 's hajj , they did not walk between the hills of safa and marwah and did not gather at arafat . some would maintain silence during the whole course of pilgrimage . except for those from the quraysh tribe , pilgrims would perform tawaf while naked . during the initial years of muhammad 's prophethood , the pilgrimage season offered muhammad the occasion to preach islam to the foreign people who came to mecca for pilgrimage .

another found more modern points of comparison for the film 's visual extravagance : " the movie opens with a burst of wild imagery ... in which mosjoukine appears in roles as widely varied as a martyr burning at the stake and a silk-hatted roue visiting the sort of underground cabaret-brothel-opium-den that david lynch would be conjuring 70 years later . ( more lynchian than lynch , mosjoukine 's nightclub comes equipped with a curtain that burns from the bottom up as it is being raised ) . " he also found greater coherence in its structure : " but for most of its running time , " le brasier ardent " seems to be following a similarly oneiric , free-associative structure , as the husband finds himself hiring z ( a partner in an exclusive , clandestine detective agency , where the operatives are psychologists as well as investigators ) in a misguided attempt to recapture his wife 's affections . it 's all the more impressive , then , when the film finally reveals itself to have been following the sequence of events laid out in the dream sequence all along .

chemical reactions are either endothermic or exothermic , as expressed by their change in enthalpy . many reactions are highly exothermic , so many industrial-scale and oil refinery processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway . these include hydrocracking , hydrogenation , alkylation ( sn2 ) , oxidation , metalation and nucleophilic aromatic substitution . for example , oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and ortho-xylene into phthalic anhydride have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed .
although lenin honed the idea in terms of a class leadership forged out of a proletarian vanguard specifically to describe marxist-leninist parties , the term is also used for many kinds of movement conceiving themselves as initially guided by a small elite . theodor herzl , the theorist of zionism , thought legitimation from the majority would only hinder from the outset his movement , and therefore advised that " we cannot all be of one mind ; the " gestor " will therefore simply take the leadership into his hands and march in the van .

several earlier color order systems had placed colors into a three-dimensional color solid of one form or another , but munsell was the first to separate hue , value , and chroma into perceptually uniform and independent dimensions , and he was the first to illustrate the colors systematically in three-dimensional space . munsell 's system , particularly the later renotations , is based on rigorous measurements of human subjects ' visual responses to color , putting it on a firm experimental scientific basis . because of this basis in human visual perception , munsell 's system has outlasted its contemporary color models , and though it has been superseded for some uses by models such as cielab ( " l * a * b * " ) and ciecam02 , it is still in wide use today .

nystrand 's research on classroom discourse probes the role of classroom interaction in student learning and was the first large-scale empirical study to document the role of open classroom discussion in student learning . his study with l. wu , a. gamoran , s. zeiser , and d. long was the first-ever use of event-history analysis to investigate classroom discourse . dialogic instruction focuses not on what teachers provide or do to students but rather on how teachers and students collaboratively negotiate . high quality classroom discourse is characterized by substantive reciprocity between teachers and their students . in such instruction , students and not just teachers have a lot of input into the business of the classroom and hence what is learned . nystrand 's companion computer program , class provides a number of measures designed to assess the quality of interaction between teachers and their students . for example , in dialogically organized instruction , teachers engage their students in probing and substantive interactions , and the talk is more like conversation or discussion than recitation . in these classrooms , teachers validate particular student ideas by incorporating their responses into subsequent questions , a process collins calls " uptake . " in the give and take of such talk , student responses and not just teacher questions shape the course of talk . the discourse in these classrooms is therefore less predictable and repeatable because it is " negotiated " and jointly determined - in character , scope , and direction - by both teachers and students as teachers pick up on , elaborate , and question what students say . such interactions are often characterized by " authentic " questions , which are questions asked to get information , not to see what students know and don 't know ; i.e. , authentic questions are questions without " prespecified " answers . these questions convey the teacher 's interest in students ' opinions and thoughts . hence , in contrast to the " test questions " of recitation , they indicate the priority the teacher places on thinking and not just remembering . these " instructional conversations , " as tharp & amp ; gallimore call them , engage students because they validate the importance of students ' contributions to learning and instruction . the purpose of such instruction is not so much the transmission of information as the interpretation and collaborative co-construction of understandings . in this kind of classroom talk , teachers take their students seriously
